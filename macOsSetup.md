# Requirements

- [Vagrant] macOS
- [Vagrant-Hostmanager] macOS
- [VirtualBox] macOS
- [Ansible] macOS
- [Git] macOS
- [Mutagen] macOS
- [Python] + [Gitman] macOS
- [PHP] + [Composer] + [jq] macOS
- Ability to sync root CA to local filesystem and trust it
- Ability to create predefined hosts entries for dev VMs.

## Additional macOS Requirements

- [Homebrew] macOS
    * Requirement: convenient
    * Implications: without a Homebrew, the user will have to install applications manually

## Check system requirements

  Tested on macOS Catalina 10.15

# Initial Setup

## Install Dependencies

### Brew

Install Homebrew using the "Install Homebrew" command on the official website: https://brew.sh/ .

### Tools

After Homebrew is installed, install the host dependencies using the following commands.

    brew install vagrant --cask
    brew install ansible
    brew install mutagen-io/mutagen/mutagen
    sudo pip3 install gitman
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
    vagrant plugin install vagrant-digitalocean

### VirtualBox

Virtual Box can either be installed by downloading the [official installer](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) of via Homebrew using the following command. 

    brew install virtualbox --cask

*A manual step is required to enable the kernel extension.* This is indicated during setup, but the prompt is easy to miss and won't appear again on its own.

After installation, before attempting to start any virtual machines, do the following. See the screenshot below for a visual reference.

1. Open System Preferences, then visit Security & Privacy.
2. Click the lock on the bottom-left of System Preferences and supply your password to unlock these settings.
3. Toward the bottom of the screen, a message of the form "Systm software [...] was blocked from loading." should be displayed.
	1. If you don't see this message, then either the kernel extension has previously been approved, or the Virtual Box installation was not successful.
4. Click the Allow button next to the message.
5. Even with these steps, the kernel extension sometimes fails to load immediatly after installation. To proactively address this issue, at this point reboot your mac.

### Composer, JQ and Magento Access Keys

The VM currently injects Magento composer access keys when provisioning the VM. In order for this to be successful, [Composer] and [jq] must be installed on the host, and Magento composer access keys must be configured prior to starting the VM. Use the following instructions to set this up.

    # Install wget
    brew install wget
    
    # download latest 1.x composer version
    wget https://getcomposer.org/composer-1.phar
    
    # move to PATH and use standard "composer" name
    sudo mv composer-1.phar /usr/local/bin/composer
    
    # make composer executable
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/composer
    
    # download JQ executable
    wget https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.6/jq-osx-amd64
    
    # move to PATH and use standard "jq" name
    sudo mv jq-osx-amd64 /usr/local/bin/jq
    
    # make jq executable
    sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jq
    
    # install PHP
    brew install php@7.4

Once these tools are installed, generate and configure Magento composer access keys using the following workflow.

1. Visit [marketplace.magento.com](https://marketplace.magento.com) (not to be confused for magento.com or magento.cloud) and log in using your Magento.com account.
2. Visit [My Access Keys](https://marketplace.magento.com/customer/accessKeys/). Alternatively, click your name to dropdown an account menu in the top-right, click My Profile, then My Products -> Access Keys.
3. Generate a new set of access keys by clicking the Create A New Access Key button, or get the Public Key and Private Key values from a previously-generated key.
4. On your mac host, run a command of the following form to configure composer to use these:

```
composer -g config http-basic.repo.magento.com <public key> <private key>
```

## Allow changes to hosts file

The `vagrant-hostmanager` automates adding and removing hosts file entries for dev VMs, which requires the user's password. Run the following snippet to allow `vagrant-hostmanager` to update hosts file without requiring password prompt

```
HOME_DIR="${HOME}"
USER_GROUP_NAME="$(id -gn $(whoami))"
echo "
HOME_DIR: ${HOME_DIR}
USER_GROUP_NAME: ${USER_GROUP_NAME}
VAGRANT_HOME: ${VAGRANT_HOME}
"
echo "
Cmnd_Alias VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE = /bin/cp ${VAGRANT_HOME}/tmp/hosts.local /etc/hosts
%${USER_GROUP_NAME} ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: VAGRANT_HOSTMANAGER_UPDATE
" | sudo tee /etc/sudoers.d/vagrant_hostmanager
```

## When host machine is rebooted

Make sure your SSH key is added to the ssh-agent after you reboot your machine

List your keys in the ssh-agent:
```
ssh-add -l
```

If ssh key is not listed above, add it to the agent:
```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/<private_key_filename>
```

## Configure Virtualbox

Prior to provisioning the first dev env VM, Virtualbox (if being used) requires some network configuration changes using the following steps.

1. Open the Virtualbox application, and visit File -> Host Network Manager in the main menu.
2. Using the `Create` and `Remove` buttons at the top left, ensure that there are exactly two network adapters: `vboxnet0` and `vboxnet1`.
	1. If this configuration is done before provisioning any VMs, then there will already be a `vboxnet0` adapter, so all that is requried is to click `Create` to create the `vboxnet1` adapter.
	2. If this configuration was inadvertently skipped prior to provisioning a VM, both `vboxnet0` and `vboxnet1` may already exist, in which case this step can be skipped.
3. Double click the `vboxnet0` interface line, then configure the `Adapter` tab settings to match the following values.
	1. Configure Adapter Manually
	2. IPv4 Address: 10.19.89.1
	3. IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
	4. IPv6 Address: <blank>
	5. IPv6 Prefix Length: 0
4. Double click the `vboxnet0` interface line, then configure the `DHCP Server` tab settings to match the following values.
	1. Enable Server: checked
	2. Server Address: 192.168.56.100
	3. Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
	4. Lower Address Bound: 192.168.56.101
	5. Upper Address Bound: 192.168.56.254
5. Double click the `vboxnet1` interface line, then configure the `Adapter` tab settings to match the following values.
	1. Configure Adapter Manually
	2. IPv4 Address: 172.28.128.1
	3. IPv4 Network Mask: 255.255.255.0
	4. IPv6 Address: <blank>
	5. IPv6 Prefix Length: 0
6. Double click the `vboxnet1` interface line, then configure the `DHCP Server` tab settings to match the following values.
	1. Enable Server: checked
	2. Server Address: 172.28.128.2
	3. Server Mask: 255.255.255.0
	4. Lower Address Bound: 172.28.128.3
	5. Upper Address Bound: 172.28.128.254
7. Close the Host Network Manager window.

Please note - starting [6.1.28 release of VirtualBox it restricted private IP addresses](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly) for Host-only networking with 192.168.56.0/21 network. We can alter this using a new config file `/etc/vbox/networks.conf`:

    sudo mkdir /etc/vbox/

then create /etc/vbox/networks.conf and place the following content:

    # Allow DevEnv local IPs (since Virtualbox 6.1.28)
    # See: https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html#network_hostonly
    #
    # Default VirtualBox range
    * 192.168.56.0/21
    * ::1/128
    # DevEnv ranges
    * 10.19.89.0/24
    * 172.28.0.0/16
    * fc00::/7

and restart the VirtualBox application.

# Host Configuration: Trusting Root CA

When the devenv is provisioned it will either use the root CA certificate/key files in `~/.devenv/rootca/` or if the do not exist when it provisions the VM, it will create new root CA files and copy them to your host's `~/.devenv/rootca/` directory.

This root CA is used to sign certs for all domains used in the devenv. If the root CA is added to the host as a trusted cert, the SSL cert for any host will automatically be valid.

To add the generated root CA to your trusted certs list on the host machine, run this command. **At least one dev env must have been successfully provisioned prior to running this command**.

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain ~/.devenv/rootca/devenv_ca.crt
```

This will apply to any applications (including browsers) which use the operating system root certificate store. Some applications maintain their own trusted root certificate store, and will need to be configured individually.

## Firefox

For Firefox you will need to add the certificate authority manually through Firefox's interface.
* Export the Vagrant DevEnv certificate authority from your System Keychain (right-click, 'Export "Vagrant DevEnv"')
* Navigate to your Firefox preferences
  * Click "Privacy & Security"
  * Scroll down to "Certificates" and click "View Certificates"
  * Select the "Authorities" section and click "Import..."
  * Select the Vagrant DevEnv cert authority exported in the first step
